Swauth Python
=============

    Copyright (c) 2010-2011 OpenStack, LLC

    An Auth Service for Swift as WSGI Middleware that uses Swift itself as a
    backing store.

    See also https://github.com/khussein/keystone for the future standard
    OpenStack auth service.

    This is currently a work in progress of pulling Swauth out of the Swift
    repo and here into its own project. See
    https://code.launchpad.net/~gholt/swift/deswauth/+merge/62392 for the Swift
    side of things.

An Auth Service for Swift as WSGI Middleware that uses Swift itself as a
backing store.

See also https://github.com/khussein/keystone for the future standard OpenStack
auth service.

This is currently a work in progress of pulling Swauth out of the Swift repo
and here into its own project. See
https://code.launchpad.net/~gholt/swift/deswauth/+merge/62392 for the Swift
side of things.
